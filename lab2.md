# Part 3 ChatServer.java
<br>From the lab in week 2, I learned how to create and run my own server. In this process, I also learned how to get arguments from a URL and change what is displayed and stored based on the URL. In addition, I also learned how to get command line arguments when I had to get the port number to run the server.
